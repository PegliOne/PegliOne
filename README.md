I’m a smart, hard-working _nology trainee who initially studied Arts and Science at Monash University from March 2013 to June 2017. I went on to complete General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive course from December 2020 to March 2021. I then worked for Livewire Markets as a Junior Software Engineer from May 2021 to March 2023.​

I am passionate about building a career in tech, because I enjoy building user-friendly applications, solving problems and learning new skills. I always strive to write neat, efficient, readable code. You can rely on me to spot coding errors from a mile away and not lose my cool when things go wrong, as they often do in the tech world. I also have strong communication and teamwork skills, having worked a Customer Service Team Member for Coles and Kmart.​

​In my free time, I enjoy exercising, playing retro video games and spending time with loved ones.
