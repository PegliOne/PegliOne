I’m a smart, hard-working Junior Web Developer, with experience in HTML5, SCSS / CSS, Javascript, TypeScript.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. I have completed General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. After finishing the course in March 2021, I went on to work for Livewire Markets as a Junior Software Engineer from May 2021 to March 2023, where I put these skills into practise by building and maintaining the Livewire website.​

I am passionate about building a career in tech because I enjoy building user-friendly applications, solving problems and learning new skills. I always strive to write neat, efficient, readable code. You can rely on me to spot coding errors from a mile away and not lose my cool when things go wrong, as they often do in the tech world. I also have strong communication and teamwork skills, having worked a Customer Service Team Member for Coles and Kmart.​

I have also completed a Bachelor in Arts and Science at Monash University. ​In my free time, I enjoy exercising, playing retro video games and spending time with loved ones.
